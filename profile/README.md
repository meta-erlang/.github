## Hi there 👋

meta-erlang is a Yocto Project/Openembedded layer that enables developing Erlang and Elixir applications on embedded Linux development context.
It's also possible to use any other BEAM language.

The target users are those that already know or desire to use YP/OE in order to build their software and application using Erlang/Elixir
for embedded Linux projects.

You can build easily any Erlang and/or Elixir projects based on rebar2, rebar3, erlang.mk, mix and autotools.

See the meta-erlang documentation [here](https://meta-erlang.github.io).
